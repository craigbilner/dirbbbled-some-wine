# Dribbbled Some Wine

For some time I've been meaning to do a "dribbble-to-code" thing and then [this](https://dribbble.com/shots/2675059-Card-Animation) popped up in my inbox...a little later...another [great piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBSY7BOYRo4) from Paul Lewis popped up...and so I downed tools on my Elm potterings and decided to follow suit...but in a "purely" functional way.

Inspired very much by [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/0.21.0/docs/) and the classic [mostly adequate guide](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide), I decided to write the whole thing as point free as possible...and not use any libraries. So I would have to roll my own functions as and and when I needed them, twist, apply and flip my way out of any corners I found myself in and generally end up with a lot of lines of code. However...what I did find...it was really easy to debug...with no unit tests or even breakpoints, hazarding a guess at what was wrong with a single piece of "work" was relatively easy. As expected, code reuse went up, my productivity slowly went up...after making many...many mistakes and it was a very different but enjoyable experience compared to writing imperative code with classes and classic inheritance.

Enough with the preamble...this is Amit's dribbble:

and this is what my end product looks like for the web:
